# Employee Directory

## Overview

I create an employee directory with React by breaking up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

This app utilizes an API to populate random employee. The users on the app can search for employees by **"First Name","Last Name", "Email" and "Phone Number"**.

#### User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

#### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Usage

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command.

- Clone [Employee Directory Repository](https://github.com/AtimaB/Employee-Directory)
- Run `npm install` , `npm install react-router-dom`,`npm install materialize` and `npm install --save react-fontawesome`.
- Type `npm start` in console then the React application will prompt the `http://localhost:3000/`.
